#### "_Empowering the blind to navigate a sightless world â€“ because every journey begins with a step, even if taken in the dark._"


Vision AI is an **AI-powered smart glasses** solution aimed at empowering the blind and visually impaired to navigate the world around them. Through innovative features and community-building capabilities, **Vision AI enhances accessibility and fosters inclusivity**.

## Leading Causes of Blindness
- Mascular Degeneration
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts

## Problems faced by visually impaired
- Reading Impairement
- Limited navigation in enclosed areas.
- Difficulty recognizing distant people/objects
- Decision-making hindered by environmental factors and context
- Dependency on physical presence for assistance
- Lack of contextual visual information


## Statistics:
- Approximately **40 million** people globally were predicted to be blind or visually impaired in 2019, with nearly **250 million** affected by avoidable conditions.


## Economic Burden:
- Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden, with an estimated annual productivity loss of about **US$ 411 billion**.
- Vision AI aims to address the economic burden by providing an affordable alternative to existing solutions.


## **Digital Anonymity in Vision AI**

### Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR):
Vision AI prioritizes digital anonymity by securely managing Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of visually impaired individuals.
By adopting robust encryption techniques and access controls, Vision AI ensures the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive health information, promoting digital anonymity and compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:
Vision AI facilitates peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between visually impaired users and volunteers, fostering collaboration and support within a secure and private environment.
Through end-to-end encrypted P2P communication channels, Vision AI enables real-time assistance while preserving digital anonymity and protecting user privacy
  

## Our Solution:

#### READ Feature:
Vision AI's READ feature utilizes **Context based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology to convert text into context-based audio, enabling users to listen to text-based content such as mail, signboards, recipes, and more.
This feature ensures that visually impaired individuals can access and comprehend textual information in their environment effortlessly.
#### Scene Analysis:
Vision AI provides a brief description of surroundings through **scene analysis, enhancing situational awareness for users**.
This capability allows users to gain a better understanding of their environment, improving their ability to navigate and interact with the world around them.
#### Vision-based Authorization System:
**Vision AI has developed a unique and dynamic vision-based authorization system**, ensuring secure access to the device and its features.
This authentication mechanism utilizes advanced vision algorithms to authenticate users, providing a seamless and secure user experience.
#### Indoor Navigation System (INS):
Vision AI's Indoor Navigation System (INS) assists users in navigating indoor environments with ease and efficiency.
By leveraging **real-time location data and custom navigation algorithms**, Vision AI guides users through complex indoor spaces, enhancing their mobility and independence.
#### POV Vision Streaming Application:
Vision AI offers a Point-of-View (POV) vision streaming application that enables **location-based volunteer selection with live location and video streaming**.
This feature allows visually impaired individuals to connect with volunteers within a specific radius, facilitating real-time assistance and support.
#### Multilingual Support:
**Vision AI supports over 40 languages, including regional languages, ensuring accessibility for users worldwide**.
This multilingual support enhances the inclusivity of Vision AI, catering to the diverse linguistic needs of visually impaired individuals across different regions.

## Connecting user and volunteers
To help with navigating, people can connect with visually challenged people within a radius of 100 meter to 1.5 kilometres. We respect these people's right to privacy, thus we only share information that is absolutely necessary. And through a video conversation with the user, the volunteers can assist them.
